# SeniorSoulmate
A smart AI chatbot, intended for lonely senior citizens to feel some companionship in the era of COVID-19

To use this application, there are first a few steps.

1. pip install chatterbot, and pip install chatterbot_corpus *or pip3, use correct command for your editor
2. Run hackdavis.py in your terminal
3. Say hi to your SeniorSoulmate!

Note: You may need to manually pip install spacey. I found stackoverflow to provide me with any bugs I ran into when installing the chatbot quite nicely!
